## Hi, I'm Gabriel, also known as TwoBits.

I combine a solid academic background in Security (UFC/CENTEC) with hands-on experience in Backend and Game Development. From deploying secure Elixir infrastructures to publishing games on itch.io, I enjoy solving technical puzzles that require both creativity and analytical rigor.

**Tech Stack**: GDScript, Elixir, JavaScript, C#, Infrastructure Security.<br>
**Soft Skills**: Focused, analytical, and composed under pressure.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me with a book in hand, playing games, or practicing music.

You may reach me at
